# My Personal Page

This is my personal webpage built with **Kotlin** and **Compose HTML**.  
It is a small project where I experiment with modern Kotlin tools for building reactive web UIs.

## Tech Stack
- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
- [Compose HTML](https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-multiplatform)

## Features
- Clean and minimal design
- Built entirely with Kotlin(98%)
- Uses Compose HTML for UI rendering

### JS Browser (Experimental)
Run the browser application: `./gradlew :composeApp:jsBrowserDevelopmentRun --continue`  
If you need to update Yarn: `./gradlew :kotlinUpgradeYarnLock`
Run browser UI tests: `./gradlew :composeApp:jsBrowserTest`
